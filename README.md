Clubhighscores is a really lightweight highscore system.
Plugin sends scores to server when needed and server will keep highscore list. 
Server is done with php and uses json files to store information.
Plugin is python and is using sim-info-project for some of the needed information.
Currently this is used for drift scores, but there is also some implementation for keeping time based scores.
This is heavily under construction..

Cumulative scores are sent also for complete sessios.. Well atleast races. don't know why others do not work..

This is work in progress and use with own risk. I am not responsible for any potential damage caused when using this code.

I have not yet decided about the license, but I am thinking about MIT license. I should study those.
